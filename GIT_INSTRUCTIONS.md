# Git Setup & Deployment

I have already initialized the repository and committed your code locally.

## Push to GitHub
1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new) and **create a new repository** named `todo-app` (or similar).
2.  Run these commands in your terminal to push your code:

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/rohithkg-code/Todo-App.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Live Deployment
To deploy the app live:
1.  Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2.  Drag and drop the `dist` folder (`c:\Users\rohit\OneDrive\Desktop\AntiGravity\Todo App\dist`) onto the page.
